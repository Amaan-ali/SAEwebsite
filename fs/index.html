                        Formula Student is a student engineering competition in which 
                         students from different prestigious universities around the world design, build, 
                        test, and race a formula style racing car. 
                        The events are backed by industry and high-profile engineers such as Patron, Ross Brawn OBE. 
                        The competition aims to develop enterprising and innovative young engineers 
                        and encourage more young people to take up a career in engineering.

                        The project usually forms part of a degree-level project and is viewed by the motorsport industry 
                        as the standard for engineering graduates to meet, transitioning them from university to the workplace.
                        It is a kite-mark for real-world engineering experience, combining practical engineering experience
                        with soft skills including business planning and project management.

                        Each year, Formula Student sees over 100 university teams from around the globe competing in
                        static and dynamic events that will test their preparation and hard work.

                        <p>
                            In Design Event, the team presents a design report before a panel of 
                            judges.On  the  basis  of  these  documents,  the  members  of  the  jury  
                            will  evaluate  the  layout,  technical  design,  construction  and implementation of the 
                            production of  the  actual  vehicle.  Then,  there  will  be  a  discussion  where  the  
                            teams  are  questioned  by  the  judges.  These  discussions  focus  on  clarifying  technical 
                             details,  exploring  the  thinking  behind  the  chosen  design,  as  well  as  the  corresponding  
                              technical   understanding   of the students. The evaluation will not only assess the
                               quality of the technical solution 
                             in  question  but  also  the  reasons behind it.

                        <h4>Cost Report</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cost is a decisive factor in the design of  any  product.  
                            In  the  cost  analysis  event,  the  teams  must  grapple  with 
                             the  calculative  size  of  the  vehicle,  its  components,  and  
                             the  necessary  manufacturing steps and record all of this in  a  written  
                             cost  report.  The  students  must  then  answer  questions  from  the  
                             judges  relating  to  the  cost  report  on  their  prototype.  In  addition 
                              to  considering the thoroughness of the written report,  the  students’  
                              understanding  of the manufacturing process and the total cost calculation 
                              will be assessed.

                            <p>
                                Each team presents their business plan for the constructed prototype to a fictitious company 
                                represented by judges. During a ten minute presentation, the team must demonstrate why their 
                                design best fulfils the demands of their target group and show how their design can be 
                                successfully marketed. The presentation will be followed by a five minute discussion and question 
                                round with the judges. In this event the content, structure, and editing of the pres-entation, as 
                                well as the team‘s performance 
                                in delivering it, will be evaluated alongside their answers to the panel‘s questions.

                            <h4>Skidpad</h4>
                            <p>
                                During the Skid Pad event, the cars must drive a figure of 8 circuit lined with track cones, 
                                performing two laps of each circle. In each case, the sec-ond lap will be measured. The lap 
                                time gives a comparative value for the maximum possible lateral acceleration of the car. 
                                Most of the cars use aerodynamics to raise the contact pressure and thus, increase lateral acceleration. As 
                                with all the dynamic events, knocking over any of the cones results in a time penalty.

                            <h4>Acceleration</h4>
                            <p>
                                The vehicle‘s acceleration from a standing start is measured over a 75 metre straight. 
                                In addition to trac-tion, the correct engine design is especially important, either in 
                                terms of greater power or for the highest possible torque. The fastest cars cross the 
                                line in less than four seconds and can reach speeds of 
                                over 100 km/h by the end of the stretch.

                                <h4>Autocross</h4>
                                <p>
                                    In the autocross event, the FSC and FSE cars traverse  a  kilometre-long, the FSD cars
                                     traverse a 500 meter track  with  straights, curves, and chicanes. A fast lap time is a 
                                     sign of high driving dynamics, precise handling and good acceleration and braking ability.
                                    Once again, time penalties occur for those who knock over any cones. The autocross rankings 
                                    decide the starting positions for the endurance competition that follows.

                                    <h4>Endurance</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Providing the highest number of points, the Endurance is the main discipline.
                                         Over a distance of 22 kilometers the cars have to prove their durability under long-term conditions.
                                          Acceleration, speed, handling, dynamics, fuel economy, reliability ‒ the cars have to prove it all. 
                                          The Endurance also demands handling skills of the driver because there can be up to four cars on the
                                        track at the same time. 
                                        Each team has only one attempt, the drivers change after 11 kilometers.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        <h4>Efficiency</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            During the endurance race (FSC, FSE) and track drive event (FSD), fuel consumption (combustion cars) 
                                            or energy consumption (electric cars) is precisely recorded. However, the absolute fuel and 
                                            energy consumption is not what is used to calculate the efficiency score, but rather the 
                                            consumption relative to speed. This is to prevent teams from driving particularly slowly in 
                                            the en-durance competition in order to score as highly as possible in the efficiency category.
